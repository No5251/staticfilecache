This extension brings a very flexible and very, very, very fast cache to TYPO3.
It creates temporary HTML files from static pages and redirects the visitor to
the HTML file without loading TYPO3. Your server, whether Apache or Nginx,
has less work and consumes less power.

Have fun with the extension!
